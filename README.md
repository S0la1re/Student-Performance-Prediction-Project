# Student-Performance-Prediction-Project

## Project Overview
This project is focused on predicting student performance based on various academic and behavioral factors using a robust multiple linear regression model.
This project includes several stages such as: 
1. data cleaning, 
2. regression analysis,
3. testing regression assumptions, 
4. building a regression model.
